# Impermanent Loss — Understanding the Trade-off

## What impermanent loss really is
Impermanent loss is not a realized loss by itself.
It represents the difference between holding assets
and providing liquidity to an AMM.

The loss becomes permanent only when liquidity is withdrawn.

## Why it exists
AMMs rebalance assets automatically as prices change.
This means liquidity providers sell the appreciating asset
and buy the depreciating one.

This mechanism enforces market prices but creates opportunity cost.

## When it matters most
Impermanent loss becomes significant during strong price trends
rather than in sideways markets.

High volatility with mean reversion can partially offset
impermanent loss through fees.

## Why fees are not guaranteed protection
Trading fees compensate liquidity providers only if
trading volume is sufficient.

Low volume during strong price moves increases net loss.

## Key insight
Providing liquidity is not a neutral position.
It is a market-making strategy with embedded risk.
