# Liquidation Risk — Forced Position Closure

## What liquidation means
Liquidation happens when a leveraged position
no longer meets collateral requirements.

The protocol automatically closes the position
to protect lenders from losses.

## How it works
Users borrow assets against collateral.
If collateral value drops below a threshold,
the position becomes eligible for liquidation.

Liquidators repay part of the debt
and receive collateral at a discount.

## Why this matters
Liquidations happen automatically and instantly.
There is no manual intervention or negotiation.

This makes risk management critical.

## Key risks
- Rapid price movements
- Network congestion delaying transactions
- Oracle price updates triggering liquidation cascades

## Key insight
Leverage amplifies both gains and losses.
Liquidation is not bad luck — it is a structural outcome.
