# Stage 1 — Crypto Fundamentals Summary

This stage was focused on building a clear and honest understanding
of how crypto markets and DeFi protocols actually work.

The goal was not to memorize definitions,
but to understand where risks come from and why people lose money.

# AMMs and liquidity
I studied how automated market makers work, using Uniswap v2 and v3
as core examples.

Uniswap v2 helped me understand basic AMM mechanics and price formation.
Uniswap v3 showed that providing liquidity is no longer passive
and behaves closer to a managed strategy with directional risk.

# Impermanent loss
I learned that impermanent loss is not a direct loss,
but an opportunity cost compared to holding assets.

Providing liquidity means automatically selling the appreciating asset
and buying the depreciating one.
Fees only compensate this effect under specific market conditions.

Liquidity provision is a strategy, not free yield.

# Liquidation risk
I explored how liquidation works in lending and leveraged protocols.

Liquidation is not a mistake or bad luck.
It is an automated protection mechanism of the system.

Price volatility, oracle updates, and network conditions
can all trigger liquidations without human intervention.

# Oracle risk
I learned that DeFi heavily depends on external data.

Smart contracts fully trust price feeds
and cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect data.

Many major DeFi failures were caused not by bad code,
but by bad or delayed price information.

In DeFi, data risk is system risk.

# Key takeaways

- DeFi strategies always contain hidden assumptions
- Risk is often structural, not accidental
- Automation amplifies both efficiency and mistakes
- Understanding mechanics matters more than chasing yield

This foundation is necessary before working with real data,
building bots, or managing capital.
